Project on unobserved spatial confounding in causal inference, reproduction of "Papadogeorgou, Georgia, Choirat, Christine and Zeigler, Corwin M. (2019), "Adjusting for unmeasured spatial confounding with distance adjusted propensity score matching: Supplementary Materials", Biostatistics 20, 2, pp. 1-11".

This project was completed as part of the "Causal Inference" course for graduate students at Tel Aviv University by Dr. Daniel Nevo.
The project considers simulated data and real-world data for dealing with unobserved confounders that have a geographical (spatial) property.
